CANVAS Basic Usage
******************
Now that you are familiar with Canvas terms and available options and the GUI, 
we can start going through basic usages of Canvas. We will cover how to run exploits 
against different set of targets from the GUI and command-line interface in simple 
scenarios, and how to use the gained ListenerNode to interact with the compromised 
host. We will also cover how to use some of the more common modules that are useful 
during a penetration test such as Recon or Trojan modules. It is recommended to 
install a copy of Windows 7 or Windows 2003 Server on a virtual machine and use it 
as your test target.
