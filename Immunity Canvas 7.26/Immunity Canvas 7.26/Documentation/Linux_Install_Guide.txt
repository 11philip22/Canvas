CANVAS Linux Installation guide
==============================================
Last updated: September 18 2019

This document will guide you through the installation of all the required CANVAS
dependencies (NOTE: Optional dependencies are not covered and should be taken care of manually).

These packages are not able to be distributed or integrated with CANVAS for licensing
reasons, you will need to install them seperately prior to being able to run CANVAS for
the first time.

Installation of the packages is fairly straight forward and should only take a few
minutes. Immunity provides the option to automatically install all the required
dependencies through an automated installer available both for Linux and Windows.


Installation steps
==================
1. Change the current directory to where you want to install CANVAS, then decompress
the package with command below:

  $ tar -zxvf canvas-x.x.tar.gz


Package Installation Steps
==========================
Immunity recommends using the CANVAS Dependency Installer (CANVAS_ROOT/installer/linux_installer.sh)
to perform steps 2 through 8 below. This script supports Red Hat and Debian based systems
(Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, Kali, etc.). The script also allow to install python packages
in a virtual environment if chosen.

Running CANVAS Dependency Installer:

$ sudo CANVAS_ROOT/installer/linux_installer.sh

[Mon Sep 17 13:31:03 -03 2018] This will begin the Python virtualenv CANVAS dependency process.
[Mon Sep 17 13:31:07 -03 2018] The following packages will have to be installed/updated in your
system:  python python-virtualenv git wget intltool automake gtk2.0 itstool python-gtk2
build-essential python-dev libgirepository1.0-dev libcanberra-gtk3-module libncurses5-dev libgeoip-dev

[Mon Sep 17 13:33:38 -03 2018] All dependencies installed, start canvas: /media/immunity/canvas/runcanvas.sh

You are done, *remember* to use runcanvas.sh if you use the automated installer.

2. You need to update your system:

   	 - Debian based: sudo apt-get update

	   - Red Hat based: sudo yum update

3. Install or update the system packages required by Canvas:

     - Debian based, in a terminal execute the following command:
        * sudo apt-get -y install python2.7 python-virtualenv git wget intltool
          automake python-pip gtk2.0 itstool python-gtk2 build-essential python-dev
          libgirepository1.0-dev libcanberra-gtk3-module libncurses5-dev libgeoip-dev
          libglade2-0 libglade2-0-dev libvte9 libvte-dev python-vte

     - Red Hat based, in a terminal execute the following command:
        * sudo yum -y install python2 python-virtualenv git wget intltool
          automake python-pip make gcc gcc-c++ kernel-devel gtk2 python-devel
          gobject-introspection gobject-introspection-devel geoip-devel vte vte-devel
          libcanberra-gtk3 ncurses-libs ncurses-devel cairo-devel libglade2
          libglade2-devel

4. Install various python required modules througth pip:

     - In a terminal execute the following command.
        * sudo python2.7 pip install numpy pyopenssl pyzmq pyasn1 pycrypto pyyaml bcrypt pynacl geoip

5. Install various python required modules througth package manager:

     - Debian based, in a terminal execute the following command:
        * sudo apt-get -y install python-cairo python-gobject-2 python-gtk2 python-gtk2-dev python-vte

     - Red Hat based, in a terminal execute the following command:
        * sudo yum -y install pycairo pygobject2 pygtk2 pygtk2-devel

6. If you would like to use the World Map IP address for the geographical location mapping
   feature there are some further packages which need to installed.

   6.1 The GeoIP mapping database needs to be downloaded, this can be found at:
     - wget -q -c http://www.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz

   6.2 Uncompress the downloaded file with the following command:

     - gunzip GeoLiteCity.dat.gz

   6.3 You want rename the file to GeoIPCity.dat and move to CANVAS_ROOT/gui/WorldMap/ directory:

     - mv GeoLiteCity.dat CANVAS_ROOT/gui/WorldMap/GeoIPCity.dat

   6.4 Correct installation of World Map dependencies can be verified by the absence of a
       red message box in the top left corner of the World Map tab in the CANVAS GUI.

7. You should have now successfully completed the CANVAS dependencies installation. CANVAS
   can now be started via the runcanvas.sh script in the CANVAS directory.

8. Further information regarding CANVAS usage can be found in the Documentation subdirectory
   or by going to the g at the CANVAS Tutorial section located at:
