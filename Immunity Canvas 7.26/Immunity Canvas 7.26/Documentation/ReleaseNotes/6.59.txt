===New and Updated Modules==

getloggedinhashes now ported to x64 Windows. x64 Windows is also much
more stable in general.

flash_newplayer - this version of the exploit should bypass most AV's and is
best used by generating a PDF file and emailing it to your targets.

ms10_032 - This local kernel exploit works on XP SP2/3
(English/French/Japanese/etc). We believe this exploit is unique to
Immunity CANVAS!

clientd and related documentation have been updated. You'll notice the Flash-JIT
shellcode has been updated to work on more platforms.

ie_hcp - This exploit for the Tavis Ormandy 0day uploads and executes a
binary to obtain a MOSDEF shell on your target.

*CANVAS Tips 'n' Tricks*:

On unpatched hosts using Host Intrusion Protection as "virtual
patching" you may find that raising your covertness bar to "2" will
defeat it. If that doesn't work, try 5 or 11.

You can use the -C 11 argument to set covertness to 11 from the command
line.
