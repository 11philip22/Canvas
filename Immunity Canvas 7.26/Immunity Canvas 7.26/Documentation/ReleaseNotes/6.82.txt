*Date*: 4 September 2012

*Version*: 6.82 ("Delta")

*Download URL*: https://canvas.immunityinc.com/cgi-bin/getcanvas.py

*Release Notes*:

This release comes loaded with exploits. First, we include a clientside
for IE 6/7/8/9 (ms12_043) and java_forName_getField for the recent
Java7 vulnerabilities. These modules should provide excellent coverage
in clientside penetration tests.

Continuing, we have a clientside for iTunes 10.4 to 10.6.1 on Windows
and a clientside for Globalscape CuteZIP 2.1. 

Moreover, we include two new remote exploits for Evocam 3.6.6/3.6.7 on OSX 
and Ezhometech EzServer on Windows.

Finally, 4 new Novell ZENworks configuration management remote exploits
complete this month's release.

*CANVAS Tips 'n' Tricks*:

You can try out our new reporting framework by simply running canvas_report
or by visiting Report->Generate Report in the menu. There are two reports
that one can generate: Canvas and Clientside (uses data from ClientD sessions).

As opposed to our old reporting engine, report generation is entirely standalone
and does not depend on OpenOffice installation. The resulting ODT files can
be viewed in OpenOffice and other OpenDocument-compatible applications.
