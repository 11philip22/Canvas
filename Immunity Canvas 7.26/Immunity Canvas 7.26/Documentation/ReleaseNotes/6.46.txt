VAASeline README:

VAASeline uses some outside libraries to do bits an pieces of the RFB protocol, 
VAASeline concerns itself with implementing a RPC control channel over 
RFB not with the setting up of the initial RFB connection in the first place.
You can read all about how to set up the VAASeline dependencies in:
