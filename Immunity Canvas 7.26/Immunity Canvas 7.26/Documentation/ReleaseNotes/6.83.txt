*Release Notes*:

We have a lot of new modules for this release. We start with clientsides

Moreover, we include remote exploits for Microsoft SharePoint Server
and EMC networker and two remote recon modules for the DELL Chassis
web interface.

We conclude with a utility module (parallel_portscan) and a collection

to have in your toolkit.

*CANVAS Tips 'n' Tricks*:

This release includes a new Java MOSDEF implementation that enables the
use of HTTP/HTTPS payloads. This can be very useful when your targets
are in controlled/corporate environments that enforce the use of proxies.
The new HTTP payloads will transparently use system-configured proxies
(if present) giving you a point of entry into these type of networks.

We have updated three of our latest Java modules to work with the
new payloads: java_deserialize2, java_AtomicReferenceArray, java_forName_getField.
