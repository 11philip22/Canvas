*CANVAS Tips 'n' Tricks*:

Our Badtunnel module is unlike most Canvas exploits. It will not get you a shell
on the target system but will cause them to funnel their traffic through the proxy
you specify. It is best if you use your own SSL-stripping proxy (for example
MITMproxy) to view proxied traffic. However, setting the module's
self.use_spike_interceptor to true will cause a Spike proxy server to be spawned
that is capable of MITM'ing the SSL traffic.

Important user notes:
- Run this module from ClientD .
- To run this module, you *MUST* run Canvas as root. Do not attempt to modify it
  to listen on a port other than 137 - that will cause the exploit to not work.
- self.wpad_port *MUST* remain port 80, as that is the port contacted when Windows
  attempts to pull down a PAC file from WPAD
- Due to the fact that Windows has to decide to use the WPAD NetBIOS name after
  you establish its value through the exploit, it may take upwards of 10 minutes
  for the host to start routing traffic through you
- When closing this module *always* select it in the "Current Status" pane and
  subsequently click the "Stop Exploit" button. This module spawns another server
  in the background that will not stop otherwise.
- If you don't kill the ClientD instance with "Stop Exploit", grep for runcanvas
  processes running as root and kill them manually.

Configuration notes:
- If your target is running on a network with a high volume of NetBIOS name
  resolution traffic, increase the self.txid_window variable inside of getargs()
  a few orders of magnitude
- To pipe users' traffic through a different proxy than SPIKE, modify self.proxy_ip
  and self.proxy_port to be something different
