*Date*: 03 Feb 2009

*Version*: 6.43 (DOTEW)

*Release Notes*:

Following January's bumper release was always going to be tough, but we
have managed to pack a whole heap of new features both high and low
level into the 6.43 release of CANAVS.

MOSDEF 2.0 sees full integration into CANVAS this month, with an even
greater speed increase on MOSDEF parsing/lexing and compilation than
last months version (compare 6.43 to 6.41 if you don't believe us!).
MOSDEF 2.0 will also be seeing a standalone release under the LGPL this
week so keep an eye out for further details if you want to play with a
pure python 'C(like!)' compiler/assembler.

Some feedback we have been getting recently has been around the
organisation of the data CANVAS output, and we agree. So this month sees
the first integration of session support into CANVAS. At the moment this
means that the data CANVAS output all goes into one place (defined in
CANVAS.conf), which by default is 'Reports'. Beneath this lie your
session directories which in turn contain all the data pertaining to a
named session in more organised format than before. Session naming can
be done in three ways: in canvas.conf, on the command line via
--canvas_session_name=<name> and through the GUI via the new sessions
menu. A post to the forum is being readied to explain all of this in
more detail, until then suffice to say output that you may have been
used to finding in 'Your Documents', 'My Screenshots' and CANVAS.log is
now all organised into session directories under 'Reports'. The default
session name is 'default'  :) 

New exploits this month comprise of an AIX local exploit for an AIX
5.2/5.3 DIAGNOSTICS environment handling bug (CVE-2004-1329). This
module is aimed at demonstrating how to tie this class of local root
exploit into the CANVAS framework, an MS SQL remote heap overflow
(CVE-2008-5416) exploiting the replwritetovarbin stored procedure
enabled by default in SQL Server 2000 and 2005.The exploit currently
works on non-DEP enabled targets. We are also including a POC kernel MS
pool overflow (CVE-2008-4834, MS09-001) which is capable of a DOS
condition against the target. A new web application remote exploit for
the Simple Machines Forum (No CVE entry for this, check:
http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/50071) is also included.

New non-exploit modules are in the shape of BuildHTTPCallback which
creates an executable that will call back to download and execute a file
over HTTP/S, and adduser & deluser for easy creation and removal of
users on remote systems.

CANVAS is now compatible with Python 2.6 (as well as 2.5) and performs
better checks for systems running older versions of Python. General
improvements have been added to nessusxml, the httpserver used for
clientsides has numerous improvements for compatibility as well as the
list of exploits included in the server being auto-generated if a
specific client module is not specified.

Support for internationalisation of the GUI has also been added, details
of how to localise the GUI to your preferred language are in
'gui/locale' with the string template being in
'gui/locale/po/CANVAS.pot'. Given we have an international team at
Immunity expect future releases to include a variety of languages.

Finally I will just take this opportunity to remind those of you who
received a survey in your inbox that there are just two weeks left to
give us your valuable feedback and have the chance to have the feature
of your choice implemented into CANVAS.

Cheers, Rich.

*CANVAS Tips 'n' Tricks*:

Options specified in the canvas.conf file can be overridden from the
command line by taking the variable name and using it as a long
argument. e.g.

canvas_output

would be overridden by

--canvas_output=MyOutputDir
