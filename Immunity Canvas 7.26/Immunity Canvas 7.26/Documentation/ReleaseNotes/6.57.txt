*Date*: 05 April 2010

*Version*: 6.57 ("Monarch")

*Download URL*: https://canvas.immunityinc.com/cgi-bin/getcanvas.py

*Release Notes*:

==IMPORTANT Security Note==

CANVAS will start two different listeners on your local system that can
be used to obtain local root access. The XML-RPC endpoint, and the
OpenOffice UNO endpoint. You can disable these through canvas.conf if
you are using CANVAS on a multi-user system (which is not recommended).


==New Modules==

pty-shell - on Linux nodes (and currently only on Linux hosts with
gnome-vt installed) this will pop up a PTY window, allowing you to use
VIM or other tools that require a PTY on your LinuxNode. Of course, you
cannot use other MOSDEF functionality while you do this.

ie_peers_setattribute - An exploit module for IE_PEERS that should work
reliably. This exploit will defeat DEP, and of course supports HTTP and
HTTPS MOSDEF shellcode. It also supports some non-English Windows
targets - these will be auto-targted if using clientd and associated
jsrecon. They can also be set manually from the commandline if using
httpserver.

acrobat_exec - The simple PDF execution vulnerability is now in CANVAS.

acrobat_libtiff - This overflow is in CANVAS (although it may not
defeat DEP targets)

ngnix has been updated to include support for 0.7 and 0.8 version
targets. This means the vast majority of running nginx servers are
targetable.

xserver - CANVAS now includes an integrated XServer - this is useful
when using local exploits that require a valid X server connectback.


==Changes==

CANVAS's GUI is now heavily localized - this includes the targeting and
"Stop" buttons, the node "right-click" commands, and the exploit
descriptions. Several Asian language localizations are included, and
we'll help you get another language into CANVAS if you need it (we use
an automatic Google-Translate script for a large part of this). Please
note, if you don't have the font's installed for a particular language
that you are targeting you may run into trouble while hacking it. (i.e.
if hacking Traditional Chinese Windows, we recommend you have the
Traditional Chinese fonts installed). Generally we at Immunity install
a large variety of fonts on our attack systems since you may not know
ahead of time what language your targets will be running.

A new Javascript obfuscation layer was added - this allows prevention
of your exploits by many secondary protection mechanisms
(IDS/IPS/AV,etc). (See the ie peers exploit for a demo).

The Node File view now supports multiple drives on Windows.

Major improvements have been made to the in-GUI commandline interface.
__engine__ is defined as the current CANVAS engine when in PyShell mode
- allowing you to use it for automated scripting. A bug in bind-shells
from the in-GUI commandline was also fixed.

The reporting engine now can export timeline reports in OpenOffice,
XML, DOC, or PDF formats. This relies on pyuno, which is currently only
available on Linux. (apt-get install pyuno, or yum install pyuno should
work for you). Feel free to send us any ideas you want on other
reporting formats!

ClientD has been updated to define a self.plugin_info inside the
exploits it uses. This allows client-sides to do much easier targeting
at runtime.

A bug in chunkedaddencoder was fixed for people using it with large
sets of bad characters.
