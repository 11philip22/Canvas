*Date*: 04 Mar 2009

*Version*: 6.44 (Tangelo)

*Release Notes*:

The March release of CANVAS is here and contains a whole stack of new
features and modules.

A module for the Internet Explorer uninitialized memory corruption bug
client side (MS09-002, CVE-2009-0075) is included for use against
Windows XP SP2 systems. New web exploit modules also come in force with
five new PHP exploits for vulnerabilities in: 1024CMS(No CVE as yet),
phplist(CVE-2008-5887), phpSlash(CVE 2009-0517), phpYabs(No CVE, Bugtraq
ID 33670) and Sourdough(No CVE as yet).
Other new modules are GetBrowserInfo and GetAddressBookInfo which are
post-exploitation information gathering modules aimed at getting as much
data as possible from the browsers and address books of the users of a
system. Currently they are aimed at Win32 systems only and the IE,
Firefox2/3 and Chrome browsers and Outlook address book. Expect these
capabilities to expand over time and more information gathering modules
to come as well.
Finally a DNS enumerator module has been added to aid in the discovery
of hosts in a supplied domain, two word lists (dns.txt and
dns-short.txt) are also included in the Resources sub directory but you
can always throw a custom word list into the module for a more
customised approach.

The GUI has seen a few more tweaks this month with the search modules
tab moving from the right hand pane to the left (as it made more sense
for it to be here!), the node manager now has a splash of colour with
different node classes being rendered in different colours to aid
differentiation on complex attacks, the current session name being
displayed in the title bar and the inclusion of 'Check for updates'
functionality from the Help menu.

Finally I want to thank all those who responded to the survey we sent
out a couple of months ago. We found all the feedback useful and has
been taken on board. You will hopefully have started to see some of the
suggestions making their way out into CANVAS already. Pretty much all
the suggestions for specific features we thought to be great so we
expect to bring them to you over time, but the winning of the feature
request to be done first is:

'....Being able to save your state/project....'

The winner has already been notified but we are pretty sure this is a
feature which many other people will also find valuable so we are
pleased to be able to work on making this happen as soon as possible.

Just because the survey is over does not mean that we don't want to hear
idea and requests you have for CANVAS, if you have something you think
we should hear drop us a line.

Cheers, Rich.

*Third Party Spotlight*:

Long time CANVAS third party pack VulnDisco is still continuing to make
strides in both new modules and new ways to contribute. Vulndisco has
over 260 modules with new 0day being added every month, the release of
VulnDisco 8.6 will bring a further 5 new 0day to add to the pack.

VulnDisco is also unique in their use of 'research licenses'. Research
licenses are for people who are able to contribute something to
VulnDisco (not just 0days, but fixes, patches, advices, new targets ..etc).

If you want to find out more about the VulnDisco pack or the details of

*CANVAS Tips 'n' Tricks*:

Too much output in your Canvas Log Window? Ctrl-A to select all the text
and delete will clear it out so as you can identify new output easier,
but don't worry the text that you just trashed is still kept in the
CANVAS.log of your session directory for future reference.
