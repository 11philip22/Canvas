This month we are proud to release many new exploits and additional
functionality in your CANVAS Monthly Update. Today several new
vulnerabilities were announced in Adobe Reader 8.1.2 - a reliable
exploit for one of these is included this month (acrobat_js3). Likewise,
the MS08-067 exploit included in CANVAS is the most reliable exploit
available (even on Windows XP/2003 with DEP AlwaysOn!).

In the Windows world, the CANVAS Windows rootkit can now hide files, and
has been updated for reliability. This month's CANVAS also includes a
ram dumper utility which can be used to download a copy of a machine's
entire live memory for forensics or for analysis.

If you're doing Unix penetration testing, you'll be interested in the
new local exploits for AIX 5.1 and 5.2. A full changelog is included
below. As always, if you have any questions or need help, do not
hesitate to contact us!
