*Date*: 09 February 2010

*Version*: 6.56 ("BurnNotice")

*Download URL*: https://canvas.immunityinc.com/cgi-bin/getcanvas.py

*Release Notes*:

==New Modules==

GetLocale - gets the locale of a Win32 MOSDEF Node. 
disable_windows_firewall - Turns the Firewall off on a Windows machine -
    useful for bouncing.
brightstor_cmdexec - CVE-2008-4397 (automatically runs a MOSDEF callback using
    the CANVAS TFTP service)
ie_dumpfiles - CVE-2010-0255 - downloads files off an IE client, assuming they
    can talk to your SMB server.
 
==Changes==

CANVAS's GUI is now partially localized. If run on a locale such as Chinese or
Japanese CANVAS will automatically display localized information. Feel free to
send us better translations, of course. We will be working to extend and
enhance this in the future. A bug that prevented CANVAS from starting in
multi-byte directories has been fixed as well.

Likewise, internal functions have largely been replaced with Unicode-friendly
functions. This means the file browser, dir, chdir, getcwd(), and piped
commands (Listener Shell) will work much better on non-English Windows.

"quit" works better from the commandline. 

The default behavior if CANVAS cannot narrow down the language pack of a remote
Windows is now "not to attack it". Previously it was "Assume it is English". This
can be changed via the configuration module or as a MassAttack2 option.

Various bugs in reporting were also fixed.
