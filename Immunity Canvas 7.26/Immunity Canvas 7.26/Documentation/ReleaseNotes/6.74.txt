We include two new modules in this release. The first, frontpage_rpc_fileupload,
takes advantage of frontpage server extensions in order to upload a file
that will trigger a MOSDEF callback.

vulnerability (CVE-2011-3544) that is being exploited in the wild. 

Finally, we include improvements to the PyELF framework and our underlying
MOSDEF support for Android and fixes to padding_oracle, thunderbird_backdoor
and jboss_jmxconsole_deployer.

*CANVAS Tips 'n' Tricks*:

The Java client side exploits are very reliable across underlying platforms and
browsers. All they require is a vulnerable Java installation that manifests via
the Java plugin in a browser. This months exploit, java_rhino, works nicely
on Windows, Linux and OSX in all major browsers. You should try it!
