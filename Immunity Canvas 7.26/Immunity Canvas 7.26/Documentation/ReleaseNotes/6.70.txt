*Date*: 30 June 2011

*Version*: 6.70 ("Kingdom")

*Download URL*: https://canvas.immunityinc.com/cgi-bin/getcanvas.py

*Release Notes*:

This release includes the DNS MOSDEF listener backend that will
allow clientsides to communicate with CANVAS over DNS traffic,
making them harder to detect and also better able of escaping
corporate firewalls. The ms11_003 IE7 exploit has been modified
to work with the new DNS payload.

Moreover, we include new exploits for the DHClient command injection
and Wireshark DECT dissector vulnerabilities, an exploit for the
tinyeditor component of vulnerable Joomla installations, qualysguard
which replaces our qgimport and qgverify modules and, last but not
least, a backdoor for Mozilla Thunderbird.

*CANVAS Tips 'n' Tricks*:

After compromising a target, one can run thunderbird_backdoor_deployer which
will scan all user directories for the presence of Thunderbird profiles
and install a backdoor. The whole process is automatic and completely 
effortless!

Once a backdoor has been installed, one can control it remotely via email
using our thunderbird_backdoor_manager module. Commands and responses
are steganographically encoded inside PNG attachments, and the emails
used for transfer automatically marked as SPAM.
