*Date*: 07 April 2009

*Version*: 6.45 (CherryChapstick)

*Release Notes*:

The April release of CANVAS has finally arrived and it is another mamoth release. This month much focus has been placed on 
how users interact with CANVAS and we hope you like the considerable improvements we feel we have made.

A quick summary of this months new features are:

* New CANVAS commandline shell, in the GUI and from the CLI
* New node management GUI window with improve selection & menuing
* Session save and restore to save the state of LocalNode
* New HTTP Proxy tunneling module & HTTP(S) MOSDEF rebuild
* MOSDEF ActiveX module to return a Win32Node from browsed object
* Javascript obfuscation on modules using javascript code
* New PDF exploits & improvements on old one to add exploit to supplied PDF
* A variety of other tweaks and bug fixes

CANVAS now has a fully integrated commandline shell that allows for session support and remote interaction with the CANVAS 
engine. You are able to attach and detach from sessions, juggle multiple callbacks, and
shellshock nodes from the GUI. The commandline communicates to the
CANVAS engine over XMLRPC, which means you can now attach a commandline
CANVAS client to a remote GUI engine (e.g. over SSH) and interact with the active nodes in this engine. The CANVAS 
commandline is now driven by a real interpreter, and allows you to script in Python right from the CANVAS shell!

You can see the new commandline integration in action at:

Expect to see more features being added to this over the coming months.

The Node management in the GUI has been completely rewritten to try and provide a more user friendly, intuitive and 
streamlined experience. Nodes are now selected via left clicks, have a single right click menu to display their knowledge 
and associated listenrs etc and can be dragged around to group them as users require. There is going to be a tutorial in 
the forums soon showing all the new features of the node manager, but a quick summary is as follows:

* Left click - select node
* Ctrl+Left click - multi node select
* Left click + mouse move - drag node
* Right click - display nodes knowledge & target options
* 'Enter' or 'l' - Open a listener window on the node
* 'Space' or 'b' - Open a file browser window on the node
* 'Delete' - Close a node (and it's children)
* '+'/'-'  - Zoom in and out

The winner of the competition to request a feature was announced last month and we're pleased to include that feature this 
month. Save/Restore on your CANVAS session is now available from the session menu in the GUI and will save the state of the 
LocalNode including all it's known hosts, their knowledge bases, currently targeted host, interfaces, current callback 
interface and their associated listeners for each interface. This is an area we expect to continue to add more features to 
in the coming months.

DNS names are now automatically resolved and placed onto the World Map when hosts are added or discovered.

Finally a small tweak has been added to the search facility allowing you to search over ALL of the modules metadata for a 
search term rather than confining the search to a particular atrribute (though you still can if you want). Search over ALL 
is now the deafult search type from the drop down box.

Let us know if you like these new ways to interface with CANVAS or start a discussion thread on the forum at 
(http://forum.immunityinc.com).

Along with all the UI improvements this month we also have a set of new CANVAS modules for your exploitation needs.

First up is a completely revamped HTTP MOSDEF tunneling solution. CANVAS can now transparently tunnel MOSDEF connections 
over HTTP/HTTPS using the new http_proxy module. The new implementation reuses existing proxy settings on the target and 
will function through a wide array of popular web proxy solutions, including SPIKE Proxy. The new HTTP MOSDEF 
implementation is backwards compatible with existing HTTP MOSDEF clientside exploits and by popular demand you can now 
shellshock a HTTP MOSDEF connection. Pretty freaking cool.

The Mosdef ActiveX module gives you a fully code signed, sealed, delivered ActiveX control that will install into the 
remote hosts computer. You deliver it via the httpserver module and it will automatically set the listener up for you.
As soon as someone visits the HTML page it calls the CheckVersion()
method of the ActiveX control and gives you a Win32 MOSDEF shell.

If you use the module standalone, you define the listener and HTTP host
parameters so that you can host the ActiveX on an IIS or Apache server
of your choice, just make sure the CANVAS_AX.cab file is also on your
web server. You need to start the associated listener for this to work
correctly.

To remove the control on the target's machine simply browse to the file
in file explorer "C:\WINDOWS\Downloaded Program Files\CANVAS_AX.ocx" and
right-click. Select "Remove" from the drop down menu, and the ActiveX
will no longer be installed.

PDF exploits have received a fair amount of attention from us this month with the inclusion of three new exploit modules 
and improvements to previous PDF exploit modules. New modules come in the shape of FoxitLaunchit (CVE-2009-0836), 
foxit_Action (CVE-2009-0837), adobe_js4 (CVE-2009-0927), adobe_jbig (CVE-2009-0658). All PDF exploits are now able to add 
their exploits to a user chosen PDF file, or to the blank.pdf supplied with CANVAS as was the previous behavior. 
Additionally Javascript obfuscation has been added to the CANVAS modules that use javascript to aid in AV evasion.

A new Linux clientside is also included this month for the NetworkManager DBUS permission error (CVE-2009-0365). As far as 
we are aware, this is the only exploit publicly available for this bug.

The DNSFind module if now threaded and so performs significantly better than previous versions.

So that about wraps it up for this month, we hope you like the new feature we have added - but as always we'd love to hear 
from you if you have any specific comments for us.

Cheers, 
Rich.
