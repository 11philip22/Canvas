RUNNING VISUALSPLOIT ON WINDOWS
===============================

Untar VisualSploit into CANVAS root directory using winzip or winrar. 
If it gives you an error about corruption, ignore it. 

This will create a CANVAS/VisualSploit_NAME/$

From CANVAS root directory, move VisualSploit_NAME to VisualSploit

X:\CANVAS\ move VisualSploit_NAME VisualSploit

then,

Use vsrun.bat located at CANVAS/ to start the VisualSploit GUI. 


All vsrun.bat does is set up the path environment variable so python can find
the GTK libraries. 

Note for users of SPANISH WINDOWS:

path that is looking for is \Program Files\Common files\ but the installation
of those three packages was in other path, because the Windows is in Spanish,
the correct path is \Archivos de Programas\Archivos Comunes\.


RUNNING VISUALSPLOIT ON LINUX
=============================

Untar VisualSploit into CANVAS root directory using tar. 

CANVAS/$ tar zxvf VisualSploit_NAME.tar.gz

This will create a CANVAS/VisualSploit_NAME/$

Change to CANVAS root directory

cd CANVAS

and move VisualSploit_NAME to VisualSploit

CANVAS/$ mv VisualSploit_NAME VisualSploit

then,


from CANVAS root directory execute:

CANVAS/$ python -W VisualSploit/main.py

Please be sure to have python bin in system PATH, otherwise
full path will be needed.

For example:

CANVAS/$ /usr/bin/python -W VisualSploit/main.py
