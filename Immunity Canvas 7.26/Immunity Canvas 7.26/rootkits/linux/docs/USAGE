THINGS TO KNOW:

Run from gui and set filehide and passwd
*Rootkit hides files that contain the filehide string.
*Programs that contain this string are given root priviledges when
runned and are hidden.
*Childs of this programs are also root and hidden, no matter what
there name is
*TCP sockets of programs/childs are hidden
*A backdoor is installed along with rootkit, you can use linrootkit
inject to retrieve a MOSDEF shell at any time. You need to remember
the password you set.
*Rootkit is loaded at runtime automatically

USAGE:
*You need to make the module for the exact kernel you are going to
attack, else the module won't load.
-First figure out what distribution and kernel they are using, then
recreate enviroment in a VM(same kernel). You need gcc and the kernel
headers. Move immrt.c immrt.h and Makefile to the VM and run make. If
everything goes right, you will end up with a immrt.ko file, overwrite
the immrt.ko file in CANVA/linux/rootkit with that one. Everything
should work now.

CLEANING UP:

*When you want to clean things up you can do the following.
(replace immrt with your filehide string everywere)
cp /bin/bash /bin/immrtbash
run immrtbash
Delete:
/lib/modules/immrt.ko
/etc/init.d/immrt
/etc/rc0.d/S01immrt
/etc/rc1.d/S01immrt
/etc/rc2.d/S01immrt
/etc/rc3.d/S01immrt
/etc/rc4.d/S01immrt
/etc/rc5.d/S01immrt
/etc/rc6.d/S01immrt

Use find to find any other file you created and delete those too.
