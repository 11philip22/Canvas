VAASeline: VNC Attack Automation Suite

About:
---------------
VAASeline is an implementation of a technique by which a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) mechanism
can be set up over the Remote FrameBuffer (RFB) protocol upon which VNC relies. The technique
allows arbitrary actions to be scripted against a target running a VNC server without requiring
user interaction.

This technique was first presented at BlackHat EU 2009.

This tarball include a Python module (VAASeline.py) which implements the technique in an easy
to use way. It also includes a demo program to show off how to use the VAASeline module, as 
well as a specific implemenation of some actions that VAASeline can be used to construct
(ApplyVAASeline.py and cb_mon.vbs).

Pre-requisites:
---------------
VAASeline using some other libraries to do bits an pieces of the RFB protocol, VAASeline concerns itself with implementing a RPC control channel over RFB not with the setting up of the initial RFB connection in the first place.

The libraries can be found at:

VAASeline requires version: 0.6.4 - old I know, but whatever - it does what we need very well.

Requires:
rfb.py
cripple_des.py
image.py

Copy to the libs subdir of VAASeline. Don't forget to thank Euske for his great work with pyvnc2swf :)

Usage:
-----------------
run `python ./vaaseline-demo.py <ip of VNC server>`

and a little demo of echoing, running a command (calc.exe) and uploading and executing a binary
will be run. 
NOTE: By deafult the binary that is attempted to be uploaded is 'uploadme.exe'

VAASeline is really meant as a library on top of which to implement your own functionality. The
demo program is just an example of how this can be achieved.
