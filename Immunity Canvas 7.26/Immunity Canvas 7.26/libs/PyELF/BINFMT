The POUVELF binary format is basically a reinterpretation of the ELF binary
format that is compatible with a simplified userland elf loader.

The approach is similar to the one taken in the Self project by Pluf & Ripe,
and similar prior work in ul_exec by the grugq. But has been completely
written from scratch to work with modern glibc static binaries and driven by
a pure-python Elf parser.

The POUVELF loader currently only handles static ELF binaries. But has been
modernized to be able to deal with PT_TLS sections. It supports both 32bit
and 64bit Linux ELF binaries.
