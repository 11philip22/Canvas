  NOTES: |
      A vulnerability exists in Exim since version 4.85 that allows for the execution
      of remote commands as the root user on a system. Current version of the exploit
      installs wget if not present and then downloads a CANVAS mosdef callback from
      the CANVAS host (must be reachable via HTTP). Webserver will bind on port 80
      if CANVAS is run as root
