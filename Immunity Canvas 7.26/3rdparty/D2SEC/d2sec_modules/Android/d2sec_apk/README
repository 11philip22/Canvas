Description
-------------

d2sec_apk is a malicious Android application (in debug mode) with an embedded
Java Mosdef. This application doesn't appear in the applications list and has
no GUI. To activate it, type the secret code *#*#1337#*#* on the victim phone
or send a SMS to the victim phone with the following text ##D2SEC##. 

The d2sec_apk.py script will configure AndroidManifest.xml with the
specified Mosdef connectback Ip and Port. 

You must have the Android SDK installed. See
http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html for more informations. After SDK
installation, edit d2sec_apk/local.properties and set sdk.dir value.

This application has been compiled and tested with the Android Virtual Device
Target Android 2.3.3 - API Level 10 and with the phone HTC Wildfire S A510e.
