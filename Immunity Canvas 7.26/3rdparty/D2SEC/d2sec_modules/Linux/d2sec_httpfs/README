Description
--------------

d2sec_httpfs is a FUSE-based filesystem that uses HTTP messages to mount a
remote directory on a local machine, relying on a generated server-side script
(only PHP script with this version) installed on the server.

The following options are available: 

  * Creating and deleting files and folders, 
  * Reading and writing files 
  * Etc..

Each operation (reading, deleting, listing) results in the transmission of one
or multiple HTTP requests. Thus, the tool leaves traces in the logs.

Usage
-------

 1. mkdir /tmp/d2 && python2 ./d2sec_httpfs.py -o server=10.0.0.164 -o uri="/fuse/eval.php" -f /tmp/d2
 3. nautilus /tmp/d2
 4. fusermount -z -u /tmp/d2

It is recommended to disable certain nautilus options (overview files, counting
the number of files in a folder, etc..) to limit the number of queries.
