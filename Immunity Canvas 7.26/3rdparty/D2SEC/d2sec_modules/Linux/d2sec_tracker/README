Description
-------------

d2sec_tracker is a Script Kiddies tracker. d2sec_tracker modifies /bin/bash.
and hooks fork(), execve(), and exit(). Right now d2sec_tracker can be used to
achieve 2 different goals:

1/ "prevent" stupid hackers from exploiting vulnerable services on the box it
is installed on: 

d2sec_tracker calls getpeername() in order to check whether stdin and stdout
are connected to an inet socket or not..  if they are, and if there is no
environment variable or if HISTFILE is set to /dev/null, the shell is
terminated. Otherwise, all the commands executed by the shell will be stored in
the /var/tmp/.zman* file, since an inet shell is highly suspicious anyway..

2/ detect the activity of kiddies and terminate their shell: 

d2sec_tracker is handled each time the shell executes a command, and works like
spamassassin. When commands that are typical of kiddies activity are executed
(id, uname -a, last for example), a score is increased, and if it reaches some
fixed threshold the shell is killed and information is stored to the
/var/tmp/.zman* file.
 
d2sec_tracker modifies /bin/bash and hooks fork(), execve(), and exit().
It uses IPC messages queues for the communication between a shell and its
children, write()s "Segmentation fault" to the stdout of suspicious shells and
terminates them, but logs useful information to a /var/tmp/.zman* file first.

Install d2sec_tracker
-----------------------

See d2sec_backweb/README to install d2sec_tracker on /bin/bash binary. It's the
same methodology.
