Description
--------------

d2sec_dnsfs is a FUSE-based filesystem that uses a DNS tunnel to mount a remote
directory on a local machine.

The following options are available: 

  * Creating and deleting files and folders, 
  * Reading and writing files 
  * Etc..

Each operation (reading, deleting, listing) results in the transmission of one
or multiple DNS requests. 

Usage
-------

 1. Configure src/conf/dns2tcpdrc and src/conf/dns2tcpdrc to specify domain
 2. On the server: 
    $ ./bin/dns2tcpd -F -f conf/dns2tcpdrc 
    $ python server/start.py -k conf/test_rsa.key
 3. On the client:
    $ ./bin/dns2tcpc -f conf/dns2tcprc -r ssh -l 1089 -z domain -k foobar ns1.afraid.org
    $ python client/dnsfuse.py localhost:1089 mnt/

And the filesystem is mounted on /mnt.

It is recommended to disable certain nautilus options (overview files, counting
the number of files in a folder, etc..) to limit the number of queries.
