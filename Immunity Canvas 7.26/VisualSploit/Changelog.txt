1.1 July 1, 2006

New Features:

o Pad2Len Object added: this object takes in another buffer and
pads it to a certain length and includes it in another buffer. This
is essential because our shellcode will be a different size potentially
every time it is created.

o Objects can be commented now (right click into object -> object comments)

o Clear Packet added: Removes all buffers from exploit packets

o Object Link State added: Objects that are directly linked to another object
[like jumps or pad2lengths] are automatically refreshed as they or they linking
object changes [position inside exploit buffer, or values/sizes]

o Multiple targets managing (Right click into an EIP object to access multiple
targets managing)
