*Date*: 23 May 2010

*Version*: 6.58 ("TimeWarp")

*Release Notes*:

==New Modules==

getloggedinhashes - This module is useful especially on domains. Currently it
only supports 32-bit but work is underweigh to port it to 64-bit MOSDEF.

ie_peers_flash - This exploit defeats DEP by using the Immunity
Flash-JIT code, which has itself been ported to Flash 9.

ms10_025 - This exploit is reliable against Microsoft Media Server both
pre- and post- the Microsoft failed patch. It steals the socket and has 
otherwise been polished and should work for you in the wild.

ms10_026 - This exploit (not elsewhere released) for Microsoft Media
Player has been tested to work on IE 7 and XP SP3. This exploit works
with the new ClientD.

acrobat_exec - This exploit raised a lot of media publicity, but is still
useful against unpatched Acrobat Reader and gullible users.

java_deserialize and java_method_chain - Both modules target the same patch
version of Java, although java_method_chain is less likely to be something an AV
company has looked at. Both exploits work with the new ClientD.


==Changes==

Major revisions have been made to ClientD and to the internal CANVAS
engine. The engine has been updated to suport Universal Listeners. This
simple concept required major modifications internally, but now, for
example, all of your attacks against ms08_067 can call back to port 25,
whether you are attacking one host, or a class B. Universal Listeners
are compatible with commandline usage as well.

Likewise, ClientD now only accepts Universal MOSDEF or HTTP MOSDEF as
callback types. Major changes have taken place inside ClientD, making it
much faster and more reliable. It now orders exploits by their likelyhood
of success against each target that connects, for example.

Among the many ClientD changes. 

o Reporting has been centralized, and the client-side reporting (for
now, only Text), is much cleaner and easier to use.

o Exploits have easy access to their session and recon information

o Speed has been drastically improved

o Many exploits and their shellcode have been extensively modified
(SafeSEHsearchcode now supports VProtect and is used by
acrobat_newplayer, f.e.).

You will find documentation on how to write exploits that work with the
new ClientD here: Documentation/CANVAS_Clientd.odt

For those of you doing advanced CANVAS modifications, MOSDEF has been
updated to support function pointers.

*CANVAS Tips 'n' Tricks*:

On unpatched hosts using Host Intrusion Protection as "virtual
patching" you may find that raising your covertness bar to "2" will
defeat it. If that doesn't work, try 5 or 11.

You can use the -C 11 argument to set covertness to 11 from the command
line.
