*Date*: 30 March 2012

*Version*: 6.78 ("5.25")

*Download URL*: https://canvas.immunityinc.com/cgi-bin/getcanvas.py

*Release Notes*:

Our new module for this release is java_AtomicReferenceArray 
(CVE-2012-0507) which has been available in CANVAS early updates
(https://www.immunityinc.com/ceu-index.shtml) since March 7.

It is a heavy-hitting exploit that affects a broad spectrum of
Java versions and will be extremely useful in a lot of penetration
testing assignments. Immunity's AlexM did a video demonstration
a while back which can be seen here:

Moreover, we include up to date documentation for our recently
introduced ARM MOSDEF engine, ClientD bugfixes for NAT interfaces
and, last but not least, HTTP/HTTPS callback support for
BuildMOSDEFDLL.

==Changes==

*CANVAS Tips 'n' Tricks*:

The new HTTPS BuildMOSDEFDLL support can be used in order to establish an encrypted
link between a MOSDEF process and CANVAS. CANVAS also supports encrypted executable
trojans and we have had great success using them in order to evade various AV solutions.

A new video that demonstrates these features has been posted at:
