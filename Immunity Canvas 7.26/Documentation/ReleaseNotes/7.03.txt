*CANVAS Tips 'n' Tricks*:

In this release we started refactoring CANVAS code to be more efficient
and easier to understand. As you can see from the included changelog, we
reorganized our exploits directory to be a bit clearer. As an example:

CANVAS/exploits/remote/windows/ms08_067/ms08_067.py
CANVAS/exploits/clientside/windows/ms14_064_ie_oleaut32/ms14_064_ie_oleaut32.py
CANVAS/exploits/local/unix/recvmmsg/recvmmsg.py

You'll note we've segregated modules based on their type and operating
system. This should hopefully be more intuitive than just placing
everything in the root of the exploits directory. We are allowing a
transition period in which you will still be able to place exploits
inside the root of exploits/, although that won't be the case in the
future and you will have to place them in their respective subdirectories.
