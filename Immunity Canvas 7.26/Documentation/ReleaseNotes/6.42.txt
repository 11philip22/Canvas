*Date*: 06 Jan 2009

*Version*: 6.42 (HighFivesAndFluteMusic)

*Release Notes*:

Happy New Year everyone! We thought the start of 2009 was a good time to
mix a few things up and set you up for what to expect from CANVAS in the
rest of 2009.

The release announcement is the first change you may notice in all it's
ASCII glory! This will now not only let you know what has changed in
CANVAS in the previous month but will also try and present you with Tips
and Tricks for using CANVAS, upcoming events where you will be able to
meet the CANVAS developers, future Immunity training classes and  links
to relevant content on the CANVAS forums as well as the rest of the
InterWeb. This month also see the release of new CANVAS third party
pack, see the 'Third Party Spotlight' section below for details.

The forums are another area that will be receiving much more attention
in 2009, we encourage you to sign up for an account at
http://forum.immunityinc.com and get involved with the discussions that
will be taking place there. We will also be announcing future CANVAS
releases over RSS as well as the email list so subscribe your news
readers to
http://forum.immunityinc.com/index.php?type=rss;action=.xml;board=2.0
for the stream.

The 6.42 (HighFivesAndFluteMusic) release of CANVAS is one of the
biggest yet and contains an huge array of new features and improvements.

A deep down change that we are releasing this month is a new lexer and
parser for MOSDEF (cparse2.py). This is deep down inside of CANVAS and
has been in development for the last couple of months, it is responsible
for taking the 'C-Like' MOSDEF code that CANVAS post-exploitation
actions are coded in and taking them to an intermediate language which
is then assembled to the specific CPU and OS of a target. The upshot of
the new lexer/parser for end users is a fairly significant speed
improvement, and improved memory usage, for developers it is the start
of more work in this area as well as easier to follow CANVAS code -
watch this space.

Another change that will be immediately noticeable this month are the
new GUI features. Search, new modules, favourite modules and
dataview(BETA) are all now included in the GUI. Modules can now be
searched on a variety of criteria including MS Advisory number, CVE
ID/URL, Vendor, OS etc etc. [BETA designation is due to known issues of
the dataview tab with multi-threaded scans such as massattack2]

Also at the top of the list of CANVAS modules you will see two new
sections: 'Favourite exploits' and 'New exploits'. 'New exploits' is a
section that will contain all the new modules added in that months
release. 'Favourite exploits' is a user configurable section that will
contain the modules that you define. To populate this section add the
names of the modules as they appear in the 'exploits' directory one per
line to the text file 'Resources/favmodules.txt'. An example
favmodules.txt is included.

The dataview tab is a new way CANVAS modules output their results, that
allows you to select and export the data without having to dig through
CANVAS logs. Dataview is currently BETA with only dcedump and osdetect
supporting it but we wanted to let you see it early and watch it grow
over time.

Other small but useful GUI tweaks have been added as well such as
'Enter' being usable instead of having to click 'OK', and new user added
host knowledge automatically being selected as the target. See here for
more details: http://forum.immunityinc.com/index.php?topic=281.0

Various new exploit modules are available this month the first being
NTLMv1 credential reflection attacks that can both reflect back to
connecting clients (MS08-068) as well as through to additional targets.
NTLM credential reflection is a known attack that revolves around
feeding a connecting SMB client the challenge key of a session initiated
to a system they have known credentials on. The resulting credentials
generated based on the supplied challenge are then reflected (re-used)
on the targeted system. See here for more details:
http://forum.immunityinc.com/index.php?topic=277.0

The much vaunted XML parsing vulnerability in Internet Explorer
(MS08-078) is also included this month and is usable against targets
that have DEP enabled. Finishing off this months new exploits is another
addition to the ever expanding set of PHP exploits in CANVAS, this time
in the Roundcube webmail server (CVE-2008-5619) which has been being
used via automated attacks in the wild.

This month also sees the release of new CANVAS reconnaissance modules
providing the capability to identify machines based on their ICMP or TCP
fingerprint. There's two modules involved: ipfingerprint (which
generates a fingerprint) and ipheuristic (which takes a fingerprint and
generates an OS match). ipfingerprint requires raw socket capabilities
(i.e. root on Linux LocalNode at the moment). During normal CANVAS usage
osdetect will call ipfingerprint only if it has not already been able to
determine the operating system from an application level signature. Feel
free to send us any mismatches! See here for more details:
http://forum.immunityinc.com/index.php?topic=282.0

Further new reconnaissance modules come in the shapes of ICMPSweep,
ARPScan, ARPScanner and UDPportscan for gathering intelligence in
various low footprint ways.

As with every month there are also numerous tweaks and fixes included in
response to the feedback we have received from you. We also want to
acknowledge those of you who take the time and effort to highlight bugs
and issues to us or to send in patches or code suggestions - Thanks guys!

So there you have it - the bumper New Year release of CANVAS. We hope
that you find all the new features as useful as we have. If you have any
feedback for this release be sure to let us know in the forums
(http://forum.immunityinc.com).

Cheers, Rich.
