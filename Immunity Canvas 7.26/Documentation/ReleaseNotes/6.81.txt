*Date*: 9 July 2012

*Version*: 6.81 ("Return")

*Download URL*: https://canvas.immunityinc.com/cgi-bin/getcanvas.py

*Release Notes*:

This release comes loaded with new exploits. First, we include a local privilege
escalation module for the FreeBSD SYSRET kernel vulnerability that has been making
the rounds lately. Next, three new clientsides: IE8 Midi engine, MSCOMCTL.OCX
and Adobe Flash Player <= 11.1.102.55 will certainly prove valuable additions 
to any attack toolkit.

Continuing, two new remote exploits: mysql_login_remote will exploit the recent
MySQL authentication bypass vulnerability and strutsCodeInjection will give you
access to a wide variety of systems that run Apache Struts.

Finally, we include a MySQL version detection module, a new configuration module
that will be further expanded in the future and, last but not least, 
transparent, dynamic SSL support for our Linux, OSX and ARM9 shellservers.
