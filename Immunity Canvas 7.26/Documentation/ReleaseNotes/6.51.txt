########################################################################

*Date*: 05 October 2009

*Version*: 6.51 (ThanksForAllTheFish Release)

*Release Notes*:

An exploit for the much awaited SMBv2 Vulnerability (CVE-2009-3103) has
been addded to CANVAS this month. Two versions exist, a local
token-stealing exploit, and a remote connect-back exploit, both reliably
working against Windows Vista and Server 2008 SP1 and SP2 on x86
architectures. Be careful, using those exploits against x64 machines
will result in a blue screen!

Also new this month is the native .app version of CANVAS for OS X which includes all the dependencies bundled together along with CANVAS. This means that now on a mac all you need to do is download the .app, unzip it and double click and you are ready to go - nothing else needed.

A new shellscript installer for CANVAS along with it's dependencies (on Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora and Redhat) - This is still BETA so all feedback on peoples experience using this would be appreciated. This can be found in installCANVAS/installCANVAS.sh .

New install documentation for Windows, Linux and OS X in the /Documentation Directory.

In the /Documentation/Tutorials directory you will find a new tutorial covering how to use HCN as well as some of the old tutorials converted to PDF. More will follow over the coming weeks.

The October release contains the following changes and new modules:

New install script for Linux, also grabs dependencies for Fedora, Redhat, Debian and Ubuntu. This is BETA so please let us know how you get on with this.

New splash screen - can be controlled through the variable 'splashscreen' in canvas.conf.

CANVAS can now be downloaded packaged in .tar.gz, .zip and a passworded .zip (to help avoid filtering gateways corrupting files)
