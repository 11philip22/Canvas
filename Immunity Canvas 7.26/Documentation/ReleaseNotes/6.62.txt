o MS10_048 now supports x64 targets (against all Windows platforms)

==New Modules==

ms10_061 - This exploit works well against Windows XP boxes where a
printer is shared - likewise, other Windows machines may be vulnerable
(see the Microsoft note in the Documentation for more information). It
will automatically load MOSDEF on the target machine.

flash_wild2 - This exploit requires that the target machine does not
have DEP, but it is not currently patched.

trendmicro_setowned - This exploit bypasses DEP on vulnerable Trend
Micro installations.

quick_punk - This exploit also bypasses DEP, and has recently been
patched by the vendor.

CF_directory_traversal - This exploit will target Cold Fusion on all
vulnerable versions and platforms. See
http://www.immunityinc.com/webex.shtml for a demo of this exploit in
action.

acrobat_ttf_sing - This exploit bypasses DEP and ASLR and is currently
unpatched.

xampp_webdav - This exploit looks for servers with the default XAMPP
WebDav password
