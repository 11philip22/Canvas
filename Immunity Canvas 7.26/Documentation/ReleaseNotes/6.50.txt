*Date*: 09 September 2009

*Version*: 6.50 (Adenine Release)

*Release Notes*:

Apologies for the slightly late release of the September version of CANVAS, we found some last minute issues during QA of the new Win32 rootkit (HCN) that we wanted to get right before we released - we hope you understand.

This months release is a bumper edition, no less than 22 new modules!
CANVAS 6.50 also introduces some significant new features along side new 
exploit modules, most notably a brand new, built entirely from scratch, 
Windows rootkit named HCN (that's Hydrogen Cyanide to those less 
chemically inclined!). This first release of HCN offers a host of 
features amongst rock solid reliability, but will be added to over the 
next few months. We encourage you to test drive HCN and let us know what 
you think. For an overview of HCN look in /Documentation for 
hcn_for_canvas_brochure.pdf
Another big new feature is SploitD, a clientside and email exploit attachment framework. This is also only the beginning of what you can expect to see from SploitD with regards to features, but we always prefer to get new stuff into your hands as soon as possible so we can get your feedback. In our tests we have found this to be a very effective attack vector.

In the /Documentation/Tutorials directory you will find a new tutorial covering how to use HCN as well as some of the old tutorials converted to PDF. More will follow over the coming weeks.

Other notable changes for this month is the updating of the graphics library (gaphas) that underlies the node manager view. It has been updated to the latest version and with it comes a significant increase in performance for nodes with multiple attached nodes, this is especially apparent on the win32 platform.

Overall the September release contains the following changes and new modules:

==New Modules==

Sploitd clientside/email framework (NoCVE)
Javascript recon browser plugin info grabber(NoCVE)
SSH Reverse Tunnel (NoCVE)

==Changes==

New version of gaphas toolkit (0.40) used for the node manager view which gives significant performance increases .

Removal of the 'Classic Node View' - all functionality is now accessible via the 'Node Manager'.

GeoIP updated to the new Python library for cross platform unity (no more COM object for Windows). Requires using the City Database not the Country database - the city database is freely available from: if you don't already have it. 

Tutorial PDF's added in /Documentation/Tutorials

New button to access the node file browser added to the listener shell

==Bug Fixes==

Removal of nodes now is properly reflected in both node manager and command line interface

Fix to module meta data to remove two false positives that were returned as true for any search string

Fix occasional CLI scrolling bug

==Known Issues==

Hiding directory names/paths which contain spaces may have unexpected results on Windows 2000, unloading the rootkit from these systems will solve the problem.


Until next month, Cheers
Team Immunity

To shut down a child node you have established on an exploited system simply
select it in the Node Management view and press 'delete' and confirm the
prompt. The LocalNode is special and can never be deleted though.
