*Date*: 02 June 2009

*Version*: 6.47 (IceIceBaby)

*Release Notes*:

The June release of CANVAS is here and brings with it a big bunch of new 
CANVAS modules. Kostya's eagerly awaited CLOUDBURST (CVE-2009-1244) VMWare
breakout bug is now included! For those of you who don't know, CLOUDBURST 
exploits a vulnerability in VMware Display functions in order to execute
code from a Guest VM into the Host. Once exploited, the exploit tunnels a
MOSDEF connection over the Frame Buffer of the Guest to communicate with
the Host.

The current version of the exploit has some requirements that *have* to
be met for the exploit to succeed:

- VMware version must be Workstation 6.5.0 or 6.5.1 or the associated
Player versions
- Guest must be a Windows VM (exploit is a .sys driver)
- User must have administrative privileges in the Guest (to install the
driver)
- VMware Tools must be installed in the VM (the driver relies on them)
- Guest must have the latest DirectX End-user Redistributable installed
(for MOSDEF Over Direct3D to work)
- Only Windows Hosts are currently supported

Breaking out of your virtual confines has never been so much fun :) 

Also included this month is an update to the iis_webdav module which now 
includes support for the IIS 6.0 unicode translation authentication bypass
bug (CVE-2009-1535). There is also a commandline 'davshell' option that allows you to do 
interactive PUT and MOVE commands. One of those silly bugs that is actually
likely to come in really useful one day.

There are also 6 more new exploits: joomlagooglebase_rfi (CVE-2008-6483), 
joomlarss_rfi (CVE-2008-5053), dokeos_rce (No CVE), phplinkadmin_rfi (CVE-2009-1025),
slogin_rfi (CVE-2008-5763) & pluck_lfi (CVE-2009-1765) included for your web hacking
pleasure.

Post attack command modules have also seen some new additions with two new
modules for recording video from a webcam attached to a target, and one for
recording audio from a microphone attached to a target. The other webcam
modules released last months have also seen some tweaks and improvements. 

The last new module this month is WiFi_key_dumper which grabs the SSID's and 
the associated WEP/WPA keys which are governed by the Wireless Zero 
Configuration service which is the default for Windows.

The Node Management interface has also seen a new tweak, with the 't' key now
being bound to redisplay the nodes in their original tree formation. So if
you have moved everything around or deleted a ton of nodes and just want to 
get it tidied up, 't' is what you want to be pressing.

A number cleanups and of bugs have also been fixed with the following modules 
being renamed:

FELINE        => ms05_040
BABYBOTTLE    => ms06_014
MS06_24       => ms06_024
msparsing_xml => ms08_078 

So if you have scripts relying on the names of these modules you should make 
the relevant alterations now.

Until next month, Cheers
Team Immunity
