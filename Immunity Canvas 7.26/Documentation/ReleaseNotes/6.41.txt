With Thanksgiving just gone and Christmas just around the corner the
CANVAS 6.41 (TooMuchTurkey) release includes a number of new exploits,
along with new features that we hope you will find as useful as we do.

New exploits come in the shape of a Lotus Domino remote exploit, a post
auth exploit in the GoodTech SSH server (to which the currently shipping
server is still vulnerable) and Simple Machines Forum and Mantis
bugtracker code execution vulnerabilities.

Feature enhancements are where this months release really shines with a
new ICMP MOSDEF proxy module, new internal threading model for parallel
scans and improved SPIKE proxy support for POST's.

In a recent assessment the Immunity penetration testing team found
itself in a situation where they had command execution on a web server
which was only allowed to talk to the outside world over ICMP. Because
they were only able to execute commands as an unprivileged user,
traditional WinPCAP based ICMP tunnelling solutions were not an option.
To work around this limitation, the team developed an ICMP tunnelling
solution that relies on the native Win32 ICMP API and does not require
Administrator privileges. These efforts resulted in ICMP MOSDEF proxy we
present to you today.

Support for automated attack strategies is an area which will continue
to improve moving forward, prior to the implementation of the new ideas
we have in this space we wanted to build a really solid foundation to
support this new functionality. This has been done, with the first
modules to take advantage of the new threading model being massattack2
and VulnAsses2 (The original massattack and VulnAssess modules are still
available as well). We hope you will see lower resource utilisation and
a modest speed improvement when using this new threaded modules.

As always, the feedback we have received from you this last month has
been invaluable and we encourage you to keep it coming - it has a direct
impact on the next release and caused a number of bug fixes and glitches
to be fixed this month.

Finally, we are excited to be meeting a few of you in person at the
CANVAS training class running here in sunny South Beach Miami on the
15-16th December. It is going to be a great few days and there are still
a couple of spots available, so if you like the sound of sun, sea &
shellcode it's not too late to sign up (admin@immunityinc.com for details).

Cheers
Rich
