CANVAS Windows Installation guide
==============================================
Last updated: July 12 2018

Immunity recommends running CANVAS on a Linux VM (such as Ubuntu or Kali), however
it is possible to run CANVAS (with some limited functionality) on a Windows system.

CANVAS would be limited by the Windows networking stack and services, and as such
modules that rely on raw sockets, local termination manipulation, and attacks that impersonate
an SMB server will not function in a Windows environment. Additionally, the local network
sniffer will also not be available.

Configuration steps are detailed below and include disabling the built-in firewall
and antivirus systems along with installing a variety of packages that CANVAS
depends on in order to function.

These packages are not able to be distributed or integrated with CANVAS for licensing
reasons so you need to install them seperately prior to being able to run CANVAS for
the first time. 

Installation of the packages is fairly straight forward and should only take a few
minutes. Immunity assembled an auto-installer that will perform all the below
steps automatically and is available at:

are disabled. *!*

1. Disable /ALL/ Antivirus and Firewall software on the system, including 
   Windows Defender (Virus & threat protection, Firewall & network protection).

           11. Windows may turn the firewall back on when changes on network interfaces occur, you can disable it via:
               - Run the command "control firewall.cpl" to display the Windows Defender Firewall settings
               - Select the "Turn Windows Defender Firewall on or off" option on the left side of window
               - Verify that the "Turn off Windows Defender Firewall (not recommended)" radio button is selected.

Package Installation Steps
==========================
--NOTE--
Immunity recommends using the CANVAS Dependency Installer to perform steps 2 through 5 below.
You can skip to step 6 if you are using our dependency installer.
--NOTE--

2. Install the Python package by double clicking python-2.7.15.msi
   	 - Available at:
	   https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.15/python-2.7.15.msi
	   
	 - Python is the language CANVAS is written in and the Python runtime and
           standard libraries need to be installed for CANVAS to run at all.

         - The installation location should be the default (C:\Python27)

3. Install the GTK+ package by double clicking pygtk-all-in-one-2.24.2.win32-py2.7.msi
   	 - Available at:
	   https://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pygtk/2.24/pygtk-all-in-one-2.24.2.win32-py2.6.msi
	   
	 - GTK+ is the cross platform library CANVAS uses to create its graphical
           user interface (GUI). This installer package also contains other required
           GUI dependencies GObject and Cairo.

         - The location of your Python 2.7 install should be autodetected
 
         - Use the default installation options

4. Install the "Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7" package
   	 - Available at:
	   https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266
	   (you will need to select "Download")

	   - The MSVC++ Compiler for Python 2.7 is required to compile certain
	   Python packages that CANVAS relies on.

          - Use the default installation options
	   
5. Install various required modules:
         - Open a cmd.exe console and set the current directory to "c:\Python27" by
           typing command "cd C:\Python27" and hitting enter
         - Type the following commands, without the double quotes hitting enter
           "python -m pip install --upgrade pip"
           "python -m pip install pyopenssl pyzmq pyasn1 pyyaml pycrypto bcrypt pynacl"

6. Decompress the CANVAS installation archive.

7. If you would like to use the World Map IP address to geographical location mapping 
   feature of the CANVAS GUI then there are some further packages which need to installed.

   7.1 Install the GeoIP com object.
          - The source code can be downloaded from:
            https://github.com/maxmind/geoip-api-mscom/tree/master/GeoIpComEx 
          - Compile the source code 

   7.2 Once downloaded unzip the GeoIP com object and install it by
       copying GeoIpComEx.dll to the SYSTEM32 folder. After this open 
       cmd.exe as Administrator, cd into the SYSTEM32 directory and run:
       'regsvr32 GeoIpComEx.dll'

   7.3 The GeoIP mapping database also needs to be downloaded, this can be found at:
       http://www.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz

   7.4 Uncompress the downloaded file. If your system does not recognise the .gz extension
       try using a different decompression program such as 7zip(http://www.7-zip.org/) or 
       winrar(http://www.rarlab.com/) which understands this filetype.

   7.5 You want to name the decompressed database file 'GeoIPCity.dat' and place it in the
       CANVAS-<your username here>\gui\WorldMap\ directory.

   7.6 Correct installation of World Map dependencies can be be veried by the absence of a
       red message box in the top left corner of the World Map tab in the CANVAS GUI.

8. You should have now successfully completed the CANVAS dependencies installation. CANVAS 
   can now be started via the canvas.bat script in the CANVAS directory.

8. Further information regarding using CANVAS can be found in the Documentation subdirectory
   or by going to the Immunity forums and looking at the CANVAS Tutorial section located
   at: https://www.immunityinc.com/products/canvas/tutorials.html
