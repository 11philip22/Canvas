OK, The CANVAS gui can now be localised once a tranlastion file is in place, 
to create a translation file do the following:

1. Make a copy of CANVAS.pot and name it with the correct language identifier
   you want e.g. en_GB.po or ja.po (for British or Japanese) and save it to
   CANVAS/gui/locale/po/*.po
2. Edit the *.po file to have the translations for the strings it contains
3. Edit Makefile in CANVAS/gui/locale to contain the language identifier of 
   your new translation
4. Run make, this creates the .mo file in the CANVAS/gui/locale/* directory
5. Execute the canvas gui with the appropriate language environmental variable 
   set: LANG=en_GB.UTF8 sh ./runcanvas.sh

#For Korean Support:
   yum groupinstall korean-support 
   LANG=ko_KR.utf8

#Japanese
   Had to modify the .po quite a bit before it would compile
   LANG=ja_JP.utf8 

locale -a to list the installed locales
