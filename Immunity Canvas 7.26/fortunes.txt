Cause pencil me in."&Anya: "Well, we could do something else you like. We could watch sports of some kind."&Xander: "Uh, I don't know."&Anya: "Men like sports. I'm sure of it."&Xander: "Yes. Men like sports. Men watch the action movie, they eat of the beef, and enjoy to look at the bosoms. A thousand years of avenging our wrongs and that's all you've learned?"
(review on Amazon by Andres De Vivanco (Redmond, WA United States)): The title "Shellcoder's handbook" made me reluctant to even buy this book. I thought it would go about explaining exploiting stack, heap overruns, bypassing memory exploitation methods and so on in order to execute shell code: basically, a book for hacking and I didn't like that....&Hopefully, like rational and ethical software security engineers will do, this book will be used more for vulnerability discovery and benign exploitation rather than malicious exploitation.

14:49 <mark> you would think that keys to a kindgom would be large and heavy, but really its just small and only takes a few bytes ...
14:12 < bas> i think you guys should go for the NG in xdev, original code execution&14:12 < bas> where you leave the bug alone
16:09 < miguel> he wants a legit pirated copy
14:33 < skylar> nicolasp: tell me what i need besides a laptop and enthusiasm
