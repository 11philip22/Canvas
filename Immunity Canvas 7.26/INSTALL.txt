INSTALLER INSTRUCTIONS FOR WINDOWS
==================================

There's a Documentation\CANVAS_Basics.pdf that will detail the installation
process for you.

Before you do this, you should know that Windows XP SP2 and Vista both limit
the outbound TCP sockets. This makes CANVAS and other network scanners slow.
We don't use WinPCAP to avoid this because WinPCAP has its own fun issues. So
although CANVAS works fine from Windows (and some of our developers use
Windows natively just to be sure) we still recommend you install an Ubuntu VM
if you want to do anything hard-core (like scan a Class C automatically using
massattack). VMWare has a free VMWare Server product which is quite good for
this exact purpose.

CANVAS Needs pyGTK and GTK+ for Windows. You can find instructions on
downloading and installing these for your Python here:
http://www.pygtk.org/downloads.html

You can track down the very latest (and hence, the best) PyGTK for
Windows by googling "pygtk installer windows". 

However, Immunity has packaged a snapshot of them all up for you in one
tarball:

https://www.immunityinc.com/downloads/PyGTK.tar.gz (you'll need WinZip or Cygwin
to unpack .tar.gz files on Windows). 

Since version 6.27 , CANVAS needs the pycairo bindings for CAIRO GRAPHICS,
which is used for graphing the node view. PyCairo for Windows is 
installed in the above tarball.

Once these are all installed, CANVAS should run by just using the canvas.bat
file. If you already have Python or PyGTK installed, you don't need to
reinstall them. If this doesn't work, most likely one of the following things
happened:

1. PyGTK didn't quite install properly because you have more than one Python
installed.

2. You forgot to install one of the executables.

RUNNING CANVAS ON WINDOWS
=========================

Unpack CANVAS into some directory on your hard drive using winzip or winrar. 
If it gives you an error about corruption, ignore it. Use canvas.bat to start the 
CANVAS GUI. If you did not select the default directory for your Python or 
GTK install, you may need to edit canvas.bat respectively.

All canvas.bat does is set up the path environment variable so python can find
the GTK libraries. 

If you're using cygwin, in some cases the executables (.exe files) included
with CANVAS for helper utilities will not untar with the +x bit set. This will
not prevent the loading of CANVAS, but CANVAS will be unable to portscan
effectively or find the interfaces on the local host. To fix this, after
untaring the CANVAS distribution .tar.gz file, please use the "chmod +x *.exe"
command from the cygwin commandline.

Note for users of SPANISH WINDOWS:
==================================

The common file path is \Program Files\Common files\ by default but the installation
of the three packages on a Spanish windows is in an other path, namely:
\Archivos de Programas\Archivos Comunes\.

Note for users of other charsets than UTF-8:
============================================

If you are using a different charset like chinese (big5), Korean (euc-kr), Arabic 
(iso-8859-6) Greek (iso-8859-7), Hebrew (iso-8859-8), Japanese (x-euc, shift-jis), 
and others, and you have installed CANVAS in a directory containing charset specific 
characters, Glade might give you an error where it can not find the main glade file 
for running CANVAS. To solve this problem, remove any charset specific character 
from path, and try running canvas again. The simplest way of doing that is just 
to move CANVAS to a partition root directory, like:

C:\CANVAS\ 


INSTALLER INSTRUCTIONS FOR LINUX
================================

You will need a current pygtk (with threading enabled) and at least python 2.5 
to run CANVAS on Linux. 

To unpack CANVAS you can type "tar xvzf CANVAS.tar.gz"

To start CANVAS, cd into the base CANVAS directory and execute './runcanvas.sh'

To run exploits from the commandline you give the full path to the exploit from
the CANVAS base directory e.g. ./exploits/exploitname/exploitname.py

INSTALLER INSTRUCTIONS FOR OS X
================================

You'll need Python 2.5 and PyGTK installed and working. You don't want to get
into a situation where you have two Pythons and only the Python 2.4 has PyGTK.

If you decide to compile pyGTK from source, here is a quicky click-list. 
http://apnaopus.var.cc/wiki/index.php/ApnaOpus_on_OSX#Installing_Gtk.2C_PyGtk

It's really not that hard - we have lots of people using CANVAS on OS X, just
not our developer team. :> 

INSTALLER INSTRUCTIONS FOR GeoIP
================================

Download and install the latest versions of GeoIP from their website.
Linux users might want to put /usr/local/lib in /etc/ld.so.conf and rerun
/sbin/ldconfig

INSTALLER INSTRUCTION FOR OPENCV
================================

 The OpenCV (Open Computer Vision) is a library of more than 500 algorithms for real time computer vision. CANVAS uses this library for detecting faces on the 'facedetection' module.
 Linux
 =====
 If you want to installed on linux, you will need the following libraries:
  libcv1 - computer vision library 
  libcvaux1 - computer vision extension library
  libhighgui1 - computer vision GUI library
  python-ctypes - Python package to create and manipulate C data types

 On ubuntu-debian should be easy as apt-get install LIBNAME
 Just in case, avoid installing the python-opencv module since it might bring compatiblities issue with CANVAS current opencv's ctype wrapper.

 Windows
 =======
 Download and Install http://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?group_id=22870&filename=OpenCV_1.0.exe
 After that, you probably will need to update the PATH.
 Right-click on "My computer" / Properties / Advanced / Environment Variables
 Modify the Environment Variable PATH, adding
   ";c:\Program Files\OpenCV\bin\" at the end, if that's the path chosen for your OpenCV installation.
