<h1>Help and Other Information</h1>

This is basically a nice little interface into SPIKE Proxy 1.1. To use it, you eithar click through the heirarchy of the requests (located to the right of the main window) or you click on request cache. You will see something like this:<br>
POST3592989045638HTTPA1.12001870221480374626616159141244082612_loginnet.passport.com<br>
Print Request Info,  rewrite request,  Display Response,  crawl,  argscan,  dirscan,  overflow
<P>


That is a &quot;request&quot; (a POST to passport.com, in fact) which you can then resubmit. If you make multiple unique requests to a particular URL, they will each be stored . Requests that are exactly alike are discarded. <P>
If you want to resubmit this request, click on &quot;rewrite request&quot;. <P>
If you just want to see information about this request, click &quot;print request info&quot;. Simple, eh?
<P>
Clicking Display Reponse will show you what the server responded with. Clicking &quot;crawl&quot; will currently display a &quot;Not Implemented&quot; error message. Clicking argscan or overflow will attempt to SQL inject or overflow any arguments SPIKE Proxy recognized. If it detects any interesting error messages, that request will be saved off and logged.
<P>
One fun thing to do is browse your entire site, then go to the top level and click &quot;argscan&quot; which will then recurse through your entire site and look for ODBC errors. Fun, huh?
<P>
