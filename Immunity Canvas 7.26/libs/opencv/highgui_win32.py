highgui_win32

UI background window thread implementation for Windows, since OpenCV doesn't
support it natively.  Wraps (and is safe for import * from) the following
OpenCV functions:

    cvStartWindowThread
    cvNamedWindow
    cvDestroyWindow
    cvDestroyAllWindows
    cvShowImage
    cvSetMouseCallback
    cvCreateTrackbar
    cvWaitKey

If cvStartWindowThread is not called, the other functions are just pass
through to their normal wrappers in the opencv.highgui module.  However,
once cvStartWindowThread is called, those functions execute calls to the
equivalent opencv.highgui methods from within a background thread, and that
thread maintains an event loop, calling cvWaitKey periodically.

By default, calls are synchronized with the window thread, so for example
a foreground call to cvShowImage won't return until the window thread has
called the actual cvShowImage method.

There is latency added by the synchronization due to the round trip thread
context switching.  Callers requiring the least impact to the foreground
thread can set the optional cvStartWindowThread 'synchronized' parameter to
False, but should appreciate that access to function parameters by the
window thread may be delayed.  For example, the foreground should not
immediately manipulate an image used as a parameter to cvShowImage.  Memory
usage may also be slightly higher if many commands by the foreground thread
are enqueued before being executed by the window thread.
