# Publish an optional "cx" namespace intended for use without having to import
# all the names into the local namespace, but minimizing duplication by
# removing any "cv" or "cv_" prefix.  With "from opencv import cx as cv" it
# then permits usage as "cv.Foo" instead of "cvFoo".

    """OpenCV namespace for functions/types/constants with any "cv"/"cv_"
    prefix removed.  Symbols not starting with cv/cv_ retain their full name.

    A leading underscore is retained in the following cases:
    - Structures/Data types (CvXxx).  E.g., cx._Mat is the CvMat structure
      and cx.Mat is the cvMat constructor
    - Names for which removing the full prefix yields an invalid identifier.
      Generally just constants with leading digits.  E.g., CV_32F is cx._32F
    - Names which otherwise collide, where a preference is for cvXxx
      functions.  E.g., CV_SVD is cx._SVD while the cvSVD function is cx.SVD
